I was introduced to the concept of digital gardens by [Kyle Shook](https://twitter.com/elyktrix) on Twitter, and since then I've been very interested in building one of my own.

Over the last few months, I've been learning so much in my new developer role that it felt like the right time to launch.

## Motivations for Planting

I wanted a less-formal place to write about coding and other interests, no SEO keywords, no minimum word count. A digital garden sounded like a great place to keep a record of the knowledge and thoughts I'm growing.

## Seeds I'll Be Watering

- **Coding**: many front-end and general development related topics such as React, CSS, and Web3
- **Music**: bands/albums I'm currently listening to, guitar, and maybe pictures of vinyl
- **Books**: physical books or audiobooks reviews
- **Self-Improvement**: some musings about self-improvement, personal growth, etc

## What's Your ~~Sign~~ Stack

I'm usually a Gatsby fan girl, but I've been using Next in several projects, so I thought this garden would be a good place to practice my Next skills. I used Tailwind for styling, and markdown for the blog posts. Checkout [my template](https://github.com/stormcloud266/nextjs-garden-template), if you're interested in the code.
