I was introduced to the concept of digital gardens by [Kyle Shook](https://twitter.com/elyktrix) on Twitter.

## Motivations for Planting

I wanted a less-formal place to write about coding and other interests, no SEO keywords, no minimum word count. A digital garden sounded like a great place to keep a record of the knowledge and thoughts I'm growing.

## Seeds I'll Be Watering

- **Coding**: I'm a front-end web developer so I'll be talking a lot about coding topics such as React, CSS, and Web3.
- **Music**: As a guitarist and huge music fan, currently-listening-to, guitar, and vinyl posts will abound.
- **Books**: Whether it's a physical book or audiobook, I am a worm. ðŸª±
- **Self-Improvement**: There will most likely be some musings about self-improvement, personal growth, etc.

## What's Your ~~Sign~~ Stack

I'm usually a Gatsby fan girl, but I've been using Next in several projects, so I thought this garden would be a good place to practice my Next skills. I used Tailwind for styling, and markdown for the blog posts. Checkout [my template](https://github.com/stormcloud266/nextjs-garden-template), if you're interested in the code.
